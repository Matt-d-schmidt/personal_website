                <h2 class="title">Let Me Introduce Myself</h2>
                <p class="font"> My name is Matthew Schmidt. I was born in <span class="effect">St. Louis, Missouri</span> and moved to <span class="effect">Birmingham, Michigan</span>, as the youngest of four siblings with an older sister and two brothers. </p>
                <p class="font">I'm passionate about outdoor adventures and spend much of my free time on the water wakeboarding and wakesurfing. When I'm not on the lakes, you'll find me exploring hiking trails and national parks. I've visited numerous parks across the country, but Glacier National Park in Montana holds a special place as my absolute favorite. During winter months, I head out west to ski, a tradition I've maintained for many years.</p>
                <p class="font">Beyond the outdoors, I have a deep love for web development and coding. I'm constantly working to enhance my programming skills and improve this website. Whether it's learning new frameworks, experimenting with design concepts, or tackling challenging projects, I find genuine excitement in bringing ideas to life through code.</p>

                <p class="font">This project was for i101 that is currently this website that was coded all by myself. I am very proud of how this webpage turned out. I learn a lot of new ways to code in HTML and CSS to get the sytle and organization just right. I learned how to connect different pages together and how to add the widgets that can take you to a new wedsite.</p>

                <p class="font"> In the final project we were tasked with taking code that was pratically completed and to finish it. There were multiple parts to this project like making a scheduler that only schedules people three times a week and takes into account there availablity that was stored on another page. I had coded this project in Java using InteliJ.</p>
