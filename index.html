                    <p class="font"> My name is Matthew Schmidt. I was born in <span class="effect">St. Louis,
                            Missouri</span> and moved to <span class="effect">Birmingham, Michigan</span>, as the
                        youngest of four siblings with an older sister and two brothers. </p>
                    <p class="font">I'm passionate about outdoor adventures and spend much of my free time on the water
                        wakeboarding and wakesurfing. When I'm not on the lakes, you'll find me exploring hiking trails
                        and national parks. I've visited numerous parks across the country, but Glacier National Park in
                        Montana holds a special place as my absolute favorite. During winter months, I head out west to
                        ski, a tradition I've maintained for many years.</p>
                    <p class="font">Beyond the outdoors, I have a deep love for web development and coding. I'm
                        constantly working to enhance my programming skills and improve this website. Whether it's
                        learning new frameworks, experimenting with design concepts, or tackling challenging projects, I
                        find genuine excitement in bringing ideas to life through code.</p>

                    <p class="font">I am a sophomore at Indiana University studying Informatics with a Business minor.
                        I'm looking to build my technical skills and gain professional experience. I'm passionate about

                        creative thinking. I'm eager to continue learning and developing my professional abilities.</p>
