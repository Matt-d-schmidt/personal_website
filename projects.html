                        myself. I am very proud of how this webpage turned out. I learn a lot of new ways to code in
                        HTML and CSS to get the style and organization just right. I learned how to connect different
                        pages together and how to add the widgets that can take you to a new website.</p>

                    <p class="font"> In the final project we were tasked with taking code that was pratically completed
                        and to finish it. There were multiple parts to this project like making a scheduler that only
                        schedules people three times a week and takes into account their availability that was stored on
                        another page. I had coded this project in Java using InteliJ.</p>

                    <p class="font">During the summer of 2025. I spent my time learning to code in JavaScript. I created
                        an Etch-a-Sketch game that allows users to draw on a grid using their mouse. I was able to the
                        ability to change the grid size, pen color, and background color using JavaScript. This project
                        helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Some of the notable things
                        are DOM manipulation in JavaScript which was used to create the grid layout and the ability to
                        listen for user input events.</p>
